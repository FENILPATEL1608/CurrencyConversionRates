# CurrencyConversionRates

A python based software that can convert your currency to or from Canadian dollars from many other currency types.
Two main files, cmdUI.py which serves as the main file, and conversionRates.py.

cmdUI.py will host a menu in the command line to serve the user an interface into our software. It will offer currency types that we can convert canadian dollars into, or out of.
conversionRates.py will handle all of the currency conversions. The cmdUI.py will accept the users options, and pass them to this file, conversionRates.py, which will return the numerical values back to cmdUI.py.

Fenil: Edit the cmdUI file to interface with the user.
Mohammad: Edit the conversionRates file to handle many different currency types.
Patrick: Admin the github, help anyone with any problems, will connect the two files to help Fenil use the functions in conversionRates.py
